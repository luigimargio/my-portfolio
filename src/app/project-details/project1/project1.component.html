      <p>
        In Treasures of Innocence, the player takes on the role of a kid with a
        passion for archaeology. The game's goal is to dig up, from deep under
        the sandbox, hidden everyday objects reimagined as ancient artifacts. As
        more objects are uncovered the player can learn more about the life of
        the kid hidden behind the innocence of childhood.

      <h2>Additional Information</h2>
      <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
      <p>
        In this project we had the goal of developing a first-person game with a
        unique twist: a simulation game with an archaeologist as the main
        character.
      </p>
      <p>
        After an intensive brainstorming phase in which we evaluated several
        ideas, we chose this concept for its feasibility. Being our first real
        project in the academy, time and resources were limited, so we
        prioritized a manageable scope.
      </p>
      <h3>Gameplay</h3>

          <h4>Treasure Hunting</h4>
          <p>
            The player will use maps drawn by the kid to locate the treasures.
            After having correctly identified the various landmarks, they’ll use
            their shovel to start digging.

          <h4>Salvaging and cleaning</h4>
          <p>
            Once an artifact has been found the dirt must be carefully cleaned
            off with the chisel. This is done through a unique puzzle minigame.

          <h4>Investigation and Storytelling</h4>
          <p>
            Found artifacts are catalogued in the archive menu. These items can
            be further investigated to discover additional information about
            their history. The overarching narrative and the artifacts’
            descriptions work together to open a small window on the kid and
            their parents’ life with both a light and tragicomic mood.

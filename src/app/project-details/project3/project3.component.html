      <h2>Additional Information</h2>
      <!-- <h3>Worldbuilding</h3>
      <p>
        In The Last Tide, I contributed to creating a rich narrative universe, where each island represents a core element: body, mind, and soul. 
        This concept shaped the design of the environments, NPCs, and the overarching story. 
        I focused on integrating the lore into the game mechanics, making the world not just a backdrop, 
        but an active participant in the gameplay, where players uncover the mysteries of a cursed archipelago through exploration and interaction.

          <p>
            I was responsible for designing the 3C system to ensure smooth and intuitive player movement, camera behavior, and interaction. 
            I designed a third-person camera with dynamic movement, adapting to different tools and gameplay situations, such as boat navigation or puzzle-solving. 
            The control scheme was designed to be accessible while allowing for complex actions like interacting with objects and solving puzzles​.

          <h3>UI/UX and Journal Design</h3>
          <p>
            For the UI/UX, I conducted extensive research on references like Pentiment and Red Dead Redemption II to craft an interface that is both functional and immersive. 
            I designed the journal to provide feedback on player progress, puzzles, and lore, using a handwritten aesthetic to match the game’s tone. 
            My goal was to create a seamless user experience, focusing on clear typography, intuitive feedback, and a minimalist approach to on-screen elements.
